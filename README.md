I followed the tutorials on the google site and made this little code in Replit.


## Four Sources:

1. https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/
This source is really good because it gives a really good outline of all the thigns you can do with this library. It then includes little code snipbits that you can copy paste into Replit or anyother program to see it work in real life. If you want to know if tkinter can do something this is the place ot go.
2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-gui-tkinter/
This source is really good because it had lots of vocabulary words and definitions that can help you along the way. This site is heavily code abundent in my opinion with lots of different screen shots and code snipbits that shows you everything.
3. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/tkinter/index-basic.php
This source is really good because it offers practice exercises and a little trinket box to actually do the little exercises in the website. This is a good way to get hands on experience at the same time learning the library. 
4. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tkinter-cheat-sheet/
This is a tkinter cheat sheet. It has all the basic stems for all the different things you can add to your gui. This includes windows, buttons, progress bars, etc. Its all in one place and easy to copy paste into your code.
